# A worked basic example of a survival analysis in R
This repository uses the `rotterdam` dataset from the `survival` package in R to work through an example of a basic survival analysis in R. This analysis examines relapse-free survival among breast cancer patients who were followed up after a primary surgery, and includes Kaplan-Meier curves for overall and group comparisons for relapse-free survival, as well as a basic Cox regression model and test of the proportional hazards assumption.
